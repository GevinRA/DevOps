# PCF Custom Controls - Postcode Validator
A Custom Control built using the PowerApps Component Framework for Dynamics 365 CE. The Control uses the http://postcodes.io/ API to validate that the entry is a valid UK Postcode. The Control highlights as 'Green' if the Postcode is validated, and 'Red' if the validation failed.
